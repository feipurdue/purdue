abstract = {Design practice in offshore geotechnical engineering has grown out of onshore practice, but the two application areas have tended to diverge over the last thirty years, driven partly by the scale of the foundation and anchoring elements used offshore, and partly by fundamental differences in construction and installation techniques. As a consequence offshore geotechnical engineering has grown as a speciality. The structure of Offshore Geotechnical Engineering follows a pattern that mimics the flow of a typical offshore project. In the early chapters it provides a brief overview of the marine environment, offshore site investigation techniques and interpretation of soil behaviour. It proceeds to cover geotechnical design of piled foundations, shallow foundations and anchoring systems. Three topics are then covered which require a more multi-disciplinary approach: the design of mobile drilling rigs, pipelines and geohazards. This book serves as a framework for undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and will appeal to professional engineers specialising in the offshore industry.},

@article{Einav2007a,
abstract = {The compression of granular materials has been traditionally modelled with the limitations of classical elasto-plasticity. The energy was implicitly assumed to dissipate from the frictional interaction of particles. However, the fact that brittle granular materials crush suggests that energy must also be dissipated from the fracturing of the grains, as in fracture mechanics. The concept of breakage as a thermomechanical internal variable was introduced in Part I [Einav, I., 2006. Breakage mechanics-Part I: theory. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 00,000-000] to describe the fracturing mechanisms. The theory allows to treat ideal theoretical materials that undergo dissipation purely from breakage with no other mechanism allowed for the energy consumption. However, as accounted for in elasto-plasticity, dissipation must also occur from the frictional rearrangement of grains. The combination of the two dissipative mechanisms of breakage and plasticity must therefore be investigated, as we do in this paper. Those two mechanisms are generally coupled, in the sense that one inevitably appears when the other develops. Plastic dissipation emerges as a by-product of breakage dissipation because after grains crush, local rearrangement must occur. This scenario may be termed an 'active breakage mechanism', and typifies compression deformations. In shear the plastic dissipation is dominant but breakage appears inevitably from grains abrasion. This scenario may be called a 'passive breakage mechanism'. Based on the coupling assumption, models are developed for granular materials. In particular, we show that in compression isotropic hardening of sands may appear without involving plastic strains, i.e., independent of frictional dissipation. This interpretation of hardening is different from the one used in classical critical state soil mechanics. However, frictional dissipation leads to plastic straining that are necessary for the models to be predictive in unloading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Granular materials are constituted of an assembly of particles. In spite of the simplicity of this assembly, its mechanical behaviour is complex. In the first stage we propose a framework to establish correlations between parameters of the supposedly continuous medium and grain properties which are assumed to be constant. However, this hypothesis is no longer valid in the case where physical (shape, size...) or mechanical properties (Young modulus Eg, Poisson's ratio vg...) of grains evolve during loading, causing the behaviour of the assembly to modify. We study the influence of the physical and mechanical parameters on grain breakage. We subsequently propose a way to model the influence of the grain breakage on granular materials and we introduce this influence in an elastoplastic constitutive model. Validations are made on two kinds of sands under isotropic and triaxial loading. Since the results of numerical computations corresponded well with the experimental data, we believe that the new model is capable of accurately simulating the behaviour of granular materials under a wide range of stresses and of taking into account, through new parameters, the individual strength of grains.},

abstract = {The occurrence and formation of crushable soils is a widespread phenomenon. Warm tropical seas give rise to deep deposits of biogenic skeletal sediments in coastal shelf areas, or exposed granitic intrusions are subjected to deep weathering resulting in decomposition. The end-bearing capacity of piles in crushable soils is important for the design of foundations in these diverse soils, but the analysis of foundations in these soils is problematic due to their compressibility and highly curved Mohr–Coulomb failure envelopes. The use of the spherical cavity expansion method offers potential for a better prediction of end-bearing capacities by taking into account soil crushability and the decrease of friction angle with increasing mean normal stress. A formula relating end-bearing pressure to the pressure to expand a cavity and the soil secant friction angle has been developed, which refines and simplifies Vesic's original equations. However, the actual model pile settlement ratio at which the predicted cavity expansion values were reached increased with soil crushability and decreased with increasing relative density. A simple linear relationship has been proposed between a soil compressibility index C p and the pile settlement ratio at which the bearing capacity predicted by the theoretical cavity expansion method is mobilized.

The formula is based on a breakage mechanics model that accounts for the evolution of the grain size distribution (GSD) due to grain crushing with only physically meaningful parameters. The model is integrated using the finite-element method to study the penetration problem. Predictions of GSDs surrounding piles and pile end-bearing capacities are validated against experiments. Next, a parametric study is carried out to quantify the effects of grain crushing on the bearing capacity, and then to establish the formula. The predictive capability of the new formula is highlighted against predictions by previous formulae, which highlights its superior origins.},

abstract = {Computer simulations of crushable agglomerates were performed using the PFC3D computer code, which adopts the distinct element method (DEM). Agglomerates were made by bonding elementary spheres in 'crystallographic' arrays, and by giving each sphere an existence probability of 0-8. Weibull statistics of the crushing strength of the resulting agglomerates, when tested singly between parallel platens, matches that of real silica sand grains. Triaxial tests on a cubical sample made of 389 agglomerates were then simulated. Curves of isotropic compression are shown, and the effect of loading rate on the position of the compression curves is discussed in relation to the practical question of performing DEM simulations as fast as possible without creating inertia errors. Other stress paths, including conventional 'drained' triaxial compression, constant mean effective stress, and constant-volume paths, were also simulated from different initial stresses along the virgin e-log p' curve. The numerical results are compared quantitatively with the testing data of the silica sand. They are also discussed in relation to characterising crushable soils during normal compression, yield, and critical states. Simulation of crushable soils using DEM provides valuable insights concerning the micromechanical origins of soil plasticity.},

@article{Cheng2004b,
abstract = {Cheng and co-workers showed how to make numerical simulations of crushable soils by the discrete element method (DEM). Stress-path tests on triaxial elements comprising crushable agglomerates have now been simulated. The plastic behaviour of this numerically generated soil closely resembles that of real sand. Crushing in the aggregate begins at stresses less than one tenth of the characteristic strength of single grains. The yield surfaces of isotropic 'lightly overconsolidated' DEM simulations are also contours of breakage, and are elliptical on Cambridge-style (q, p') plots and symmetrical about the p' axis. The points of maximum deviator stress at yield lie along lines of stress ratio M-y = +/-0.8, but the plastic strain increments at yield are non-associated, giving more contraction than normality would allow. Significantly, therefore, the stress ratio M,. was found not to coincide with critical states. All stress-path simulations yielding with q/p' {\textgreater} M-y were found to satisfy the requirements of stress-dilatancy theory. In particular, their yielding was best described using a unique Mohr-Coulomb angle of internal friction phi, correlated with dilatancy rate. Points of zero dilation were found within this regime, providing a critical-state friction angle phi(crit) = 42degrees for these very 'rough' agglomerates. They also coincided with the location of a critical-state line on an e-log p' plot. The peak angle (phi(peak)) developed in a variety of tests showed a unique correlation, reducing by progressive grain crushing as log sigma(1)(') increased. As macroscopic stress levels approached the characteristic crushing strength of grains, it was impossible even to mobilise phi = phi(crit), owing to large strains and high degrees of breakage.},

The basic concepts of critical state soil mechanics are shown to be valid, and a uniquely shaped critical state line is defined to capture the three modes of plastic deformation observed across a wide range of stresses, including particle rearrangement, particle crushing, and pseudoelastic deformation. A limiting isotropic compression line is separated from the critical state line in the $\upsilon$ – In p′ plane by a constant shift along an elastic unload–reload line. In the deviator stress – mean effective stress (q–p′) plane, the loading and bounding surfaces are homologous about the origin and defined by a simple and versatile function. Isotropic hardening and softening of the loading and bounding surfaces are controlled by plastic volumetric strains. A commonly used non associative flow rule is adopted.

abstract = {The advancement of a slender object into soil (to depths of 10s of metres) is of fundamental interest to Geotechnical Engineers.  Considerable advances have recently been made in beginning to understand some detailed aspects of the fundamental behaviour for penetration in sand using physical models.

In this project, a 180° axisymmetric model is developed, which allows viewing of soil movement as a circular penetrometer advances into the soil.  The model was tested in a geotechnical centrifuge with digital photographic techniques used to track soil movement. 

A series of 10 centrifuge tests is reported. The soil displacement during pile installation was measured.  The soil strain paths during installation were also calculated from the measured soil displacements.  The stress along the pile shaft was also measured by strain gauges during the pile installation.  The displacements show reasonable correspondence with circular (cylindrical) cavity expansion.  The amount of displacement generally increases with penetration.  After about 8 to 10 diameters of penetration, the amount of movement does not vary significantly with depth.  After the probe passes there is little systematic movement.  The magnitude of displacements drops quickly as the radial position increases. 

The influence of re-driving, soil density, gravity levels and probe tip shape was examined.   Results reveal that displacements are much less in the re-driving test.  The centrifuge acceleration has some influence on the displacement and strains. It is found that there is no significant deviation in displacement and strains for different soil density and probe tip shape.},
